Q2. Implement any one of SRTF (pre-emptive), SJF(non-pre-emptive) and Round Robin CPU 
scheduling(quantum=5) algorithms for the sample data given below. Assume all processes are CPU 
bound. 
Process Name Arrival Time CPU Burst I/O Burst 
P0 0 24 2 units after every 
5 unit of CPU burst 
P1 3 17 3 units after every 
6 unit of CPU burst 
P2 8 50 2 units after every 
5 unit of CPU burst 
P3 15 10 3 units after every 
6 unit of CPU burst 
All programs should print various performance measures (turnaround time, waiting time, response 
time for each process and system throughput) 
Assume that there is only one CPU and one I/O device in the system. The I/O device can be assumed 
to be sequential i.e. it serves only one process at a time.
